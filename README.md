# DFS Compression Library

A high-performance data compression library written in C, designed for efficient compression and decompression of data with a dictionary-based compression algorithm.

DFS (Dictionary-based File System) is a compression library that uses a dictionary-based approach to compress and decompress data. The library provides both in-memory and file-based compression APIs, making it suitable for various use cases from embedded systems to desktop applications.

## Features

- **Dictionary-based Compression**: Efficient compression using a dynamic dictionary
- **In-Memory API**: Compress/decompress data directly from memory buffers
- **File-based API**: Compress/decompress files directly
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error codes and error reporting
- **Logging System**: Built-in logging for debugging and monitoring
- **Modular Design**: Well-organized codebase with separate modules for different functionalities
- **Cross-platform**: Written in standard C99 for maximum portability
- **GUI Testing Tool**: Includes a graphical interface for testing compression with actual files
